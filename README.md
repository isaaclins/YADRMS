## Description

YADRMS is a work-in-progress project aimed at creating a custom remote desktop application infrastructure and automating tasks from multiple clients using a single Discord server. This project is built using Python for the backend and Next.js for the frontend.

## Current Features

### Repository Features
- **Automated Dependency Management**:  
    -   Uses Renovate to automatically scan for and update dependencies.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: 
    -   Utilizes GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment.

### Application Features
- **Channel Management**: 
    -   Creates and manages text channels based on unique Client MAC addresses.
- **Discord Bot Integration**: 
    -   Integrates with Discord to manage Clients and handle messages using the Discord API.
- **Dynamic Client Script Generation**: 
    -   Generates and manages the **client** [`(main.py)`](/backend/languages/python/main.py) script dynamically based on settings and modules.

## Maintenance

Maintaining the project is very easy and needs no coding! I've implemented Renovate into this project, meaning that it will scan for a newer version of an installed dependency (package.json) and will create a Pull Request automatically. This ensures that all dependencies are always up-to-date with minimal manual intervention.

### Steps for Maintenance
1. **Review Renovate PRs**: Regularly check the Pull Requests created by Renovate.
2. **Monitor CI/CD**: Ensure that the CI/CD pipelines run successfully BEFORE merging the PRs. If everything is green, then merge!
3. **Merge PRs**: After reviewing and testing, merge the PRs to keep dependencies updated.

By following these steps, you can ensure that the project remains up-to-date and secure with the latest dependency versions.

## Pipelines


This project uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. The workflows are defined in the [workflows](http://_vscodecontentref_/4) directory.
