# Discord Bot Integration

YADRMS uses a Discord bot to communicate with clients and execute commands.

## Features

- **Command Handling:** The bot listens for commands to control clients.
- **Message Routing:** Automatically routes messages between clients and the management dashboard.
- **Automation:** Supports automated tasks based on scheduled events or triggers.

## Setup

Ensure your Discord bot token is correctly configured in the environment variables. Review the [Installation Guide](../getting-started/installation.md) for more details.
